    <h2> Our Objective</h2>
    <p1>Under the management principle to “provide safe, good-quality stably and reasonably living environment for the people”. EIABC is carrying out projects for the development and utilization of water resources with the recognition that the social mission of the action is to contribute to establishing an environment-friendly and sustainable society, and to conserving the global environment. EIABC will continue environmental conservation activities based on
        knowledge, experience and determination.
        The environmental preservation program is active through all departments in the campus. Our projects also have to be approved by the program to be approved and implemented. The process enables the initiative to be influential in the campus. The whole staff encourages students project to be environmentally friendly and self-sufficient.

    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>
        We are seeking to create an eco-friendly society by taking other environmental issues seriously and engaging in research activities, holding discussions with experts, and offering proposals to government agencies and private companies.
Environmental protection is the practice of protecting the natural environment by individuals, organizations and governments.[1] Its objectives are to conserve natural resources and the existing natural environment and, where possible, to repair damage and reverse trends.[2]

Due to the pressures of overconsumption, population growth and technology, the biophysical environment is being degraded, sometimes permanently. This has been recognized, and governments have begun placing restraints on activities that cause environmental degradation. Since the 1960s, environmental movements have created more awareness of the multiple environmental problems. There is disagreement on the extent of the environmental impact of human activity, so protection measures are occasionally debated.

    <h2>International Environmental Agreements</h2>

        Many of the earth's resources are especially vulnerable because they are influenced by human impacts across different countries. As a result of this, many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources. This can include agreements that impact factors such as climate, oceans, rivers and air pollution. These international environmental agreements are sometimes legally binding documents that have legal implications when they are not followed and, at other times, are more agreements in principle or are for use as codes of conduct. These agreements have a long history with some multinational agreements being in place from as early as 1910 in Europe, America and Africa.[5]
        
        Many of the international technical agencies formed after 1945 addressed environmental themes. By the late 1960s, a growing environmental movement called for coordinated and institutionalized international cooperation. The landmark United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was held in Stockholm in 1972, establishing the concept of a right to a healthy environment. It was followed by the creation of the United Nations Environment Programme later that year.[6] Some of the most well-known international agreements include the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the Paris Agreement of 2015.</p>

    <p>
        The concept of a EIABC  university project is different from works done by other level organization. Our staff and our student body  tend to implement every principles of environmental preservations . The idea of building a green university explicitly focuses on improving the impact that buildings and the campus have on the environment. To create a green university, you need to run projects on:<br>
•	Organic food<br>
•	Renewable energy<br>
•	Gardening, landscape and biodiversity<br>
•	Low-carbon transport<br>
•	Clean water<br>
•	Recycling<br>

    </p>
    <h2>Current Projects</h2>
    <P>
        <h3>Gardening, landscape and biodiversity</h3>
        Time to get outdoors, enjoy some fresh air, and create something practical with your hands:<br>
        
        •Build a campus garden with herbs and an insect hotel<br>
        •Maintain a flower meadow<br>
        •Introduce non-toxic cleaning products<br>
        •Engage students and staff to plant a tiny forest close to the university<br>
        •Construct green roofs and rooftop gardens to literally have a green university<br>
    
<h3>Transport sustainability projects</h3>
    <P>
        Our vision is that universities help young people to become global citizens for sustainable development. This involves a lot of travelling. Some ideas to promote sustainable transport among students and staff:<br>
        
        •Distribute free or subsidized public transit passes to students and staff<br>
        • Install video conferencing software and train staff to use it<br>
        •Rent out a cargo bike to students for free and subsidise bicycles for employees<br>
        •Create a mobility policy, which makes it mandatory to compensate any flight-related greenhouse gas emissions<br>
        •Introduce electric cars to the fleet of the university and provide recharging stations<br>
    </P>
        <h3>Clean water</h3>
        <p></p>
            Water is a beautiful resource that gives birth to life on this planet. What a shame to waste it!<br>
            
            •Store rainwater from rooftops in tanks<br>
            •Install water saving devices in toilets and tabs<br>
            •Replace bottled water coolers with tap water coolers<br>
            •A good sustainability project idea is to use rainwater to flush toilets<br>
            •Install water refill stations<br>

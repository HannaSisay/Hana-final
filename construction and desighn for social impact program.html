    <h2> Our Comitment to students</h2>
    <p>
        Construction and design for Social Impact supports and complements the mission of the Construction Division and the broad goals of EIABC through courses that emphasize experiential learning and projects that develop globally-relevant, locally-sustainable designs to meet challenges and deliver on opportunities that enable individuals across local communities to more effectively realize their aspirations and ambitions.
        
        By engaging with the study of ethics in the classroom and ethnographic fieldwork off-campus, all first-year engineering students expand their comfort zones to work from the vantage points of broader mindfulness of social, cultural, and economic aspects that are inextricably connected to technology-driven solutions in today’s hyper-connected world.

    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>
        The students in the program are given access to the laboratory where they get to experiment. Through the investigation, they are able to discover their passion and how they would like to contribute to the society. Within the lab, tools and resources are available to transform ideas into prototypes; however, it is not a “Maker Space” in the traditional sense. Instead of primarily focusing on technical training and access to equipment, emphasis is placed on idea generation, refinement of concepts, and selection of effective strategies to realize worthwhile goals. The next generation of designers are given the space and time needed to develop the poise and confidence to be prepared to initiate and deliver socially responsible and culturally relevant responses to the most challenging design prompts.

    <h3>Our Students</h3>
    <p>Practical unit forms part of the Engineering Academy, where students are associates of the Academy and undertake the Associate Development Program. This consists of industry and community projects for the local society, as well as undertaking a program of professional development including an individual development plan.

        The program develops basic capabilities through a project in a social impact context, as well as other Academy activities. Students work in groups to produce an engineering solution for an industry or community client.
        
        To underpin the project, students will develop capabilities in the domains of Work (Teamwork, Communication, Project Management, Business Acumen & Professionalism), Process (Research, Design, Make & Operate), Self (Being a Professional Engineer, Personal Development and Local & Global Citizen), Thinking, and Disciplinary (Engineering Fundamentals & Specialist Engineering). The specific aspects of these capabilities developed will depend on the projects and other activities undertaken.

    <h4>Current Projets</h4>
    <P>Engineering is one of the key influences that shapes our society. Engineers don’t just work with machines, designs and electronics, they use maths and science to provide innovation and inventions that shape our society and improve the way we live and work. This means that engineers have a responsibility and also a great opportunity to ensure that the have a positive influence in society. This webinar will delve into the multifaceted role of engineering in society and provide you an insight into how you can make a difference and contribute to society being an engineer.

  <p1>
    The Ethiopian Institute of Architecture, Building Construction and City Development (EiABC) is an institute in Addis Ababa University.In 1969, the Building College merged with the College of Engineering and formed the Faculty of Technology under Addis Ababa University, and remained as such until 2009. On 6 March 2010, the institute was reformed into its current state as the Ethiopian Institute of Architecture, Building Construction and City Development.
    The workshops in EIABC build on a long-standing collaboration between ETH Zurich, the Ethiopian Institute for Architecture, Building Construction and City Development (EiABC), as well as other Swiss and international partners. These programs have resulted in a variety of research, teaching and construction projects. This yearâ€™s workshop will extend the accumulated expertise and address one of the most pressing challenges in contemporary Addis Ababa: how to make pedestrian mobility safer and more convenient in a rapidly developing, car-oriented urban environment. From August 25 to September 6 2014, twenty Bachelor, Master and PhD students from ETH Zurich and partner organizations in Ethiopia will explore concepts for improving pedestrian mobility.

        <p><h3>The Initiative to form programs for Our Students</h3></p>
  
        <p title="what motivated EIABC Administeration to for diffrent assosiaation within current and former students">
          <p>EIABC student centered field work supports ambitious student projects across the university through coursework, mentorship, and engagement with external partners. Students are challenged to undertake problem solving through the lens of engineering while combining methods and techniques from design to create elegant and mindful outcomes that go beyond merely computing technically correct answers.
            As such, the lab is home to the Engineers for Social Impact program and the Environmental preservation initiative serves as a hub of activity for designing Capstone project work, teams preparing competition entries, and student interest groups. This initiative provides a chance for students to understand the challenges faced by our society and contribute for the solution.

    <h2> Our Objective</h2>
    <p>We will start with the obvious reason. One of the main purposes of our alumni associations is to support a network of former graduates who will, in turn, help to raise 
        the profile of the university. Just like most other university student organizations, alumni associations aim to bring together like-minded individuals. But unlike 
        other student organizations, alumni programs are open to all graduates and prospective students and offer a broader networking scope. If you're heading to graduation 
        in a couple of months or have just finished your degree, joining our school's alumni association is a good way to get a foot (or three) in the door. Contact our alumni 
        association to see what sort of networking opportunities we offer. Our universities network host job fairs, mentor programs for graduates that pair outgoing students with 
        alumni in similar career fields. And remember that with alumni associations, quality can definitely trump quantity.

    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>
        One of the things to remember about alumni associations is that they want you to succeed. Of course, they're hoping that you'll use your success to help the association and university, but successful graduates are a university's best asset. It's no surprise then that most alumni associations offer a variety of career services. These can be anything from the aforementioned job fairs to things like resume workshops, job postings, and online resources for job-seekers. And most of these services are offered free of charge to alumni members. Remember the mentor programs we mentioned? These can be great tools for building your career or finding ways to maximize your earning potential.
        We enable prospective students from high school to get the neccerary assistance for their career choise. The network provides internship opportunities for student with relation to our prior graduates.
